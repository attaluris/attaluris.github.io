                I haven't felt an uncontrollable urge to write in quite a while - probably about freshman year of college - when I would feel these incoming streams of consciousness and the need to imprint them somewhere almost daily. 
                <br /> <br />
                I'm sitting on my balcony of my new apartment, the one I moved into just 10 days ago. It's a much bigger balcony than I expected, but that's because I'm used to the balconies of Berkeley. I'm not in Berkeley anymore. I'm in Oakland. Still Alameda County, but as my walk from yesterday revealed, very different. I wish I had explored Oakland more pre-pandemic, but in any case, I'll explore more in the coming months. 
                <br /> <br />  
                But now, I'm sitting on my balcony. I'm staring at the various greens of the two trees that block my view of Lake Merritt. I don't mind. I much prefer greens to blues anyway. I'm easy to please in that way. Besides, there are so many greens to notice. It's a travesty that crayola only has 49 shades of green. I think there are that many just in my line of sight today. If I look down, I see Lucy, who left the balcony just a bit ago because she saw an orange cat on the street. It's a different one than the two black cats that usually roam the building. One is named Twilight and the other I haven't been introduced to yet.
                <br /> <br />
                I'm all alone right now, just listening to the sound of my own keystrokes. Just three minutes ago, I was listening to silence. Three minutes before that, I was listening to the street traffic. Three minutes before that, I was listening to the birds chirping. And three minutes before that, I was listening to my microwave beep to let me know that the water I needed for my coffee was ready.
                <br /> <br />
                I'm drinking a cup of Folgers medium roast instant coffee. Technically two cups of coffee crammed into one cup of water. I guess I could space it out, but then I wouldn't feel justified when I put in 3 teaspoons of Stevia. Today, I decided to top it off with some milk (non-fat) and some Tennessee Honey whiskey (some fat). Whiskey was never my thing, but it does the job when I need to be warmed up, which makes coffee (or hot chocolate or apple cider) the perfect complement.
                <br /> <br />
                I came out to the balcony with the intention of reading a book called Why We Sleep. It's a popular science book to emphasize the importance of sleep. One of the biggest takeaways so far was simply a reminder of how long sleep takes up - around 8 hours a day, and more if you nap (I do). I specifically said takes up instead of takes away because of the distinction. I never was a day dreamer, so unconsciouness is where my imagination does its best work. Last night, I dreamt of a circular library filled with stacks and stacks of books and I was just in the center of it all. In my dream, I didn't open any of the books, so who knows, maybe this stream of consciouness was in one of them, tucked away in some corner somewhere. I'll try to go back tonight and will let you know.
